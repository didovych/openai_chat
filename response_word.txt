To make this meeting more fun, let's do the word of the day game. Today’s Dutch word of the day is "gezellig".

Now, "gezellig" is one of those delightful words that doesn't have a direct translation in English. It embodies a warm, cozy atmosphere and is often used to describe a feeling of togetherness or comfort that comes from spending time with friends and loved ones.

Picture a snug café on a rainy day where friends gather, sharing laughs and warmth over hot cocoa – that’s "gezellig". People use it to describe everything from a lively social gathering to a quiet evening at home.

So, whenever you're chilling with your favorite people or finding joy in life's little moments, just remember to say, “This is so gezellig!”
