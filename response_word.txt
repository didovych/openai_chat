Today’s Dutch word of the day is "Uitwaaien". Pronunciation: [out-why-en]. Literal Translation: "To blow out".
This uniquely Dutch word refers to the act of going outside to enjoy the fresh air, particularly in windy weather, often near the sea or countryside. It’s more than just "taking a walk"—it carries the connotation of clearing your mind, relaxing, and recharging by being out in nature.
